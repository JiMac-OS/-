    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>n CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.

        Selectors may apply to the following:
        
        all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2
        elements specified by attribute, in particular:
        id: an identifier unique within the document, identified with a hash prefix e.g. #id
        class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document, identified with a period prefix e.g. .classname
        elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.
        Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any elements. An ID may only be applied to a single element.
        
        Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained in the document tree. One example of a widely used pseudo-class is :hover, which identifies content only when the user "points to" the visible element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is appended to a selector as in a:hover or #elementid:hover. A pseudo-class classifies document elements, such as :link or :visited, whereas a pseudo-element makes a selection that may consist of partial elements, such as ::first-line or ::first-letter.[6]
        
        Selectors may be combined in many ways to achieve great specificity and flexibility.[7] Multiple selectors may be joined in a spaced list to specify elements by location, element type, id, class, or any combination thereof. The order of the selectors is important. For example, div .myClass {color: red;} applies to all elements of class myClass that are inside div elements, whereas .myClass div {color: red;} applies to all div elements that are inside elements of class myClass. This is not to be confused with concatenated identifiers such as div.myClass {color: red;} which applies to div elements of class myClass.</p>
